AUTHENTICATOR-RS
==================
![Continuous integration](https://github.com/grumlimited/authenticator-rs/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=master)

Authenticator-rs is a TOTP-MFA application written in Rust and GTK3.

This application is very much a work in progress.

It is initially inspired by [authenticator](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Authenticator), which sadly sort of 
[broke](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authenticator/) for me 
in the latest versions of python shipped with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

It is by no means as feature-rich as its python relative, more like a diamond in the rough. Well, maybe not a diamond, 
but definitely in the rough...
